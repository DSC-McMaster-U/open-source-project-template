[Sprint Planning](#sprint-planning)  

## Purpose 
### What is this?
This template is meant to serve as a guideline for open source project leads planning, and documenting their projects, as well as managing their team of developers. You, as a lead, can begin filling out this project once you have a rough idea of what the project will be. Every project is different, so I'd like to emphasize that its a guideline, and can be adapted and expanded upon to meet your project's needs. Every project should, however, abide by the scrum agile team development framework, and following this guideline will facilitate that. If you have any questions/comments about this document, please don't hesitate to contact me, @rawamily on discord. 

### Who's this for?
This document is for both the lead and developers reference. Once this document is complete, it will be provided to the general open source applicants (i.e. your prospective developers), as they'll be choosing which project they want to commit to, so make sure to make it appealing! That being said you, asw the lead, are free to continue making edits to this document throughout the projects timeline, and you likely will need to, however **please have it completed prior to the start of the project in September**. Planning early will make your job as a lead a lot easier during the semester as you balance this role with other commitments, so start as soon as you can!


### How should I fill it out?
It's recommended to follow the markdown template provided. You can copy the contents of this file and commit it to your project's repository, so that applicants will have easy access to it. Note that the actual guidelines start in the following section, [Project Desctiption](#project-description), so you shouldn't have this section, [Purpose](#purpose), in the final document. Each section/sub-section contains instructions for you as the lead to fill it out. All the instructions are italicized, and again, they shouldn't be in the final document so please comment them out.
